Let’s treat it in two parts: the NFT background and the swipable car layer.

1. Hero layout logic

Make one parent container that controls everything:

<div class="hero">
  <div class="hero-bg">
    <img src={currentNftUrl} alt="" />
  </div>

  <div class="hero-car-slider">
    <!-- swipeable cars -->
    <img src={currentCarPng} alt="" class="hero-car" />
  </div>
</div>

CSS (core idea)
.hero {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 1200px;           /* or whatever */
  aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;        /* hero shape on the site */
  overflow: hidden;            /* hides anything outside purple box area */
}

/* NFT background */
.hero-bg {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  z-index: 1;
}

.hero-bg img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;           /* no stretching, just crop */
  object-position: 50% 35%;    /* <-- which part of the square to show (purple box) */
}

/* car area */
.hero-car-slider {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  z-index: 2;
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-end;       /* car sits on the “ground” */
  justify-content: center;
  pointer-events: none;        /* optional if you only swipe with arrows/buttons */
}

.hero-car {
  pointer-events: auto;
  height: clamp(140px, 45%, 260px);  /* always same proportion of hero height */
  width: auto;                       /* keeps aspect ratio */
}

What this does

Square NFT file
– You can keep the NFT itself 1:1.
– The hero component is 16:9 (or any ratio you want).
– object-fit: cover + overflow: hidden means only the part inside your “purple box” is visible, the rest of the square is cropped.

Which slice (purple box) is visible?
That’s controlled by object-position. For each NFT you can store a value like:

// per-NFT config
{
  imageUrl: "…",
  focusY: 35 // 0 = top, 50 = center, 100 = bottom
}


and apply it:

<style jsx>{`
  .hero-bg img {
    object-position: 50% ${focusY}%;
  }
`}</style>


So the only region shown is the area you drew the purple box over.

2. Swipable car logic (center + scaling correctly)

Treat the car like a layer inside the same hero box:

Never size it in fixed pixels only.

Always base its size on the hero height so it shrinks/grows with the background.

Example swipe logic (React-ish):

const cars = [
  { src: "/cars/skyline.png" },
  { src: "/cars/nsx.png" },
  { src: "/cars/ferrari.png" },
];

const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

return (
  <div className="hero">
    <div className="hero-bg">
      <img src={currentNft.imageUrl} />
    </div>

    <div className="hero-car-slider">
      <button onClick={() => setIndex((index - 1 + cars.length) % cars.length)}>
        ‹
      </button>

      <img src={cars[index].src} className="hero-car" />

      <button onClick={() => setIndex((index + 1) % cars.length)}>
        ›
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
);


The important pieces for your issue:

Centering
The car is centered by justify-content: center; align-items: flex-end; inside .hero-car-slider.
No matter what size the PNG is, its “visual” center will be in the middle horizontally.

Respecting ratio when resizing
height: clamp(140px, 45%, 260px); width: auto;

The car height is always a percentage of hero height.

Width auto keeps the car’s aspect ratio.

clamp prevents it from getting too tiny or too huge.

Transparent PNGs that are visually off-center
If a car looks shifted even though CSS says it’s centered, the PNG itself probably has extra empty space on one side.
– Fix that by trimming transparency in Photoshop/Figma or wrapping it in a div and nudging it with transform: translateX(-10%) for that specific car.

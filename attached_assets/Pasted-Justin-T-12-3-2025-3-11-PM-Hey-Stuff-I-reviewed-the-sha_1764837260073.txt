Hey Stuff! I reviewed the shared link. There’s nothing wrong with experimenting or “vibe coding,” but a few important issues need to be addressed. It’s essential that you fully understand our build, our tech stack, and the repo documentation before shipping code.

1. Framework Mismatch

Replit is generating code using a framework we do *not* use.
As documented in our DRVN-LABO GitHub repo, our stack is built on Next.js, not Vite. This mismatch alone prevents direct integration.

2. Follow the Repo Structure Exactly

Please clone the repo and follow the tech stack documentation step-by-step.
Testing must also be done across all platforms:
- dApp
- Farcaster Mini App
- Base App

You’ll need to tunnel your local environment (localhost:3000) using Ngrok to ensure the app works correctly in all contexts. The docs describe this process in detail.

3. TailwindCSS Styling Issues

On the Feed page, the CSS doesn’t align with the TailwindCSS patterns defined in our repo (we’re on Tailwind v3.4). Please match your components to our existing style conventions.

4. Container Sizing & Safe Areas

Some parent containers are oversized on desktop.
We must keep layouts within OnchainKit safe areas for mini apps.
You can validate this by tunneling via Ngrok and previewing the mini app inside:
- Farcaster Dev Tools
- Base.dev
- Base App (mobile developer mode)

This allows you to see hot reloads and confirm proper scaling.

5. Database & Realtime Behavior

Replit uses Supabase by default, so the posts you’re seeing are temporary and don’t reflect our actual system.

Our build *must* use Farcaster SDKs to:

- Read the user’s FID
- Read the BaseApp clientFID (from the connected wallet through Farcaster/Base Mini App)

This can only be properly tested by tunneling your local build via Ngrok.

Example from Base Docs (clientFid):

import { useMiniKit } from 'coinbase/onchainkit/minikit'

function MyComponent() {
  const { context } = useMiniKit();
  const isBaseApp = context.client.clientFid === 309857;

  if (isBaseApp) {
    console.log('Running in Base App');
  }

  return <div>{/* Your Components */}</div>
}

6. Please Read the Repo Code Structure + Docs

Understanding:
- our folder layout
- our Next.js patterns
- our SDK dependencies (Farcaster, Base, OnchainKit)

…is critical before contributing.
Right now, the Replit-generated code can’t be accepted due to multiple incompatibilities.

If you have questions about the repo docs, Base docs, or Farcaster docs, please ask — I’m happy to help.

7. FIDs and ComposeCast Requirements

Base and Farcaster are strict about FIDs.
Although our signup form currently holds some static info, I’ll be updating the DRVN build this week so that users’ database accounts incorporate proper FID handling.

There are more moving parts than just a wallet connection because this project is:
- a dApp
- a Farcaster Mini App
- a Base Mini App

This hybrid setup means that features developed in Replit won’t work or be testable unless run through the proper environment.

Final Notes on Testing

To test features correctly, the workflow must be:
1. Clone our repo
2. Read the contributor docs
3. Set up your .env
4. Install dependencies
5. Run the project locally
6. Tunnel with Ngrok
7. Test through:

   - Farcaster Dev Tools
   - Base.dev
   - Base App (mobile developer mode)

This is the only way to ensure the mini app behaves as expected with hot reloads and accurate FID / clientFID handling.

The version of 15.3.6 is fine I just confirmed it so if you want to update the NextJS version on your side before you make your commit and PR to your branch that is fine and I will approve it since I have verified it will not break the current mini kit config.

Thank you for finding this and catching that great work : 0

Just a heads up I am working on some new CSS updates as well not major changes or overhaul just better layouts, for example side nav bar, cards, pages etc.
